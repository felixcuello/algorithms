Algorithms
==========================================================

I strongly believe that algorithms is a crucial part of programming, and learning them is a curcial parat for
any developer. I suggest to other students at my university that we need to learn and practice algorithms on
a daily basis to train your brain in the same way you train your body to be a body builder. I know the analogy
is silly and a crap, but for the lack of a better one I will leave that.

There are TONS of resources online and I am going to write down the ones that I liked the most to understand
certain topics so I can use them as a future reference. Maybe there are better ones, and if any person out there
find this repo and want to contribute, please feel free to do it.

I have marked with √ the lectures I particularly want to watch and learn, but there are some others that I live
here because of my OCD.
